# AutoShop

### [Download Latest](https://github.com/fondlez/AutoShop/releases/latest)

***

## Purpose:
* Can automatically sell specific items or some based on a few rules.
* Can automatically buy items - either up to a certain amount to make restocking easy or just everything available in the case of limited quantity items.
* Can automatically repair.
* Can protect against you accidentally selling specific items by immediately buying them back.

To open the settings, use: **`/autoshop`** or **`/as`**

### Caution
* Using the buyback feature while also using a different addon for selling to a merchant may result in cycles of selling and buying, since the other addon may not know about sale exceptions.
